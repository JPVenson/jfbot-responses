ReBAR (Resizeable BAR, Smart Access Memory) is a feature that reduces the overhead of communicating between the CPU and GPUs.

On Intel ARC, ReBAR causes about a 10% transcoding performance reduction when turned off. While this is a measureable difference, the media engine on Intel ARC is fast enough to not make a difference in terms of user experience in practice.
