For a budget server, Intel 7th gen is recommended. Retired office PCs of this generation can be found relatively cheaply in most places of the world on the second hand market.

Below are a few tips for buying these systems:
1. Look for ASUS prebuilts. They have much better compatibility than most vendors.
2. Some 6th gen machines can be upgraded to 7th gen with a BIOS update, potentially saving money. Check the manufacturer's support page for the specific model.
3. i3-7100 has the same iGPU as higher end models. If upgrading a 6th gen system, look for the i3 to save some money.
4. Upgrade the drive to a SSD if your's doesn't have one. Systems of this generation still often ship with HDDs.
5. 2x 4GB sometimes costs less than 1x 8GB. Consider them if your system has enough RAM slots.
