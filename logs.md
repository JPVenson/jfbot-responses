Please upload your latest Server logs to an external site like pastebin. The logfiles are found in the same place as ffmpeg logs, right in the dashboard.
If you dont have access to the Dashboard you can find your logfiles in the following locations:
- For Linux: `/var/jellyfin/logs`
- For Windows: `%programdata%/jellyfin/logs`
- For Docker: You need to [mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) your config directory and then navigate to that mounts folder /logs
