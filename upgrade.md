When an older system (below recommended specs) is upgraded for use as a Jellyfin server, the following items are recommended:
1. Thoroughly clean and test the system and make sure it is working.
2. Replace the power supply to a brand new unit from a reputable brand (optional)
3. Install at least 8GB of ram. (If you can't, 4GB on Linux without a GUI should work fine.)
4. Install a SSD for the OS and Jellyfin. A 120GB SSD would be sufficient.
5. Upgrade the system with an Intel ARC GPU (A310, A380 recommended)
6. Install a Gigabit Ethernet card if it doesn't have one. Intel 82574L (9301CT) is recommended.
7. Install additional storage if you plan on storing the media locally.
